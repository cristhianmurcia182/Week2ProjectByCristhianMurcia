This project comprises the project proposed during the second week of the python bootcamp offered by Globant.

The goal is to develop a system that accomplishes the following user stories:

* As a user, I want to have a contact list, so I can save all my contacts.
* As a user, I want to list all contacts in my contact list sorted by the date
they were created
* As a user, I want to create a new contact using: name, last name, age,
phone number, email.
* As a user, I want to register more than one phone number for each
contact: house, office, personal, cell phone, etc.
* As a user, I want to update an existing contact.
* As a user, I want to "hide" a contact of my contact list, I want not to
delete it because probably I want to have it back later.
